# Hak5 & FlipperZero HID Attack Payloads & Functions


This repository contains payloads designed for various hardware hacking tools, including the USB Rubber Ducky, Bash Bunny, OMG cable, and FlipperZero. Primarily written in PowerShell and Duckyscript, these languages are commonly used for developing such payloads. If you have questions or need help, contact me using the information in this README. These payloads can automate processes, execute commands, or exploit system vulnerabilities, making them useful for penetration testing, cybersecurity research, and interacting with computer systems.
